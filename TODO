- User-facing:
    - Event proposal: lecture, workshop, open space (CRUD)
    - Volunteership
    - Sponsorship

- Admin:
    - # Create a conference, halls, tracks
    - # Starting a CFP
    - # conferences#show -> admin dashboard
    - proposals#index -> grouped by user
    - volunteers#index -> approved volunteers
    - events#index -> approved events
    - sponsorships#index -> generate token, links to send around
    - scheduling -> calendar with events

    - users:
      - # edit profile: image upload and stuff
      - # show profile
      - Edit profiles instead

    - Home-area user CRUD
    - Controller before_action that checks for current_conference
    - Devise view styling

Notes:
  - .row > .col-lg-12 -> put that outside of the "yield"?
  - human_attribute_name -> create a short alias?
