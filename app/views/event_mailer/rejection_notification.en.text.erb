Hi,

Regretfully, because of the high amount of talk submissions that we've received this year and the limited amounts of time and rooms that we have, your submission for a <%= @event.event_type.name.mb_chars.downcase %> titled "<%= @event.title %>" was not included in the program.

As the topic might still be interesting to our audience, it would be possible to join as a lightning talk (a five-minute talk with or without slides) during the conference.

The sign-up for these talks happens at the registration of <%= @event.conference.title %> after the opening on Saturday.

See you soon,
<%= @event.conference.title %> team
