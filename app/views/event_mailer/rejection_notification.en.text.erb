Hi,

Regretfully, because of the high amount of talk submissions that we've received this year and the limited amount of time that we have, your submission for a <%= @event.event_type.name.mb_chars.downcase %> titled "<%= @event.title %>" was not included in the schedule.

If you prefer, you can present your talk in 5 minutes in the Lightnign talks slot (that's for short, 5 minute talks). The sign up for these would be at the venue itself, during the event.

See you soon,
<%= @event.conference.title %> team
